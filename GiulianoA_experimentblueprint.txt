Experiment Blueprint Ð Schema/Category Task-Switching	The proposed experiment will test the ability of participants (vmPFC patients and healthy matched controls) to decide whether incoming stimuli belongs to a presented schema or category. From this data I will be able to compare kinds of prior knowledge by analyzing their behavioural and neural outputs, in addition to indexing how prior knowledge is processed in the brain. The task will include four possible prompts (two schema and two category) in which participants will be presented with word stimuli that vary in relatedness to the prompt. The stimuli will include targets (prompt-congruent), old lures (words that served as targets for the previous prompt, but not the current prompt), new lures (words that were not previously presented, but are not currently relevant to the prompt), and irrelevant stimuli (words that are not relevant to any prompt). Also, throughout the task, the prompt will change pseudo-randomly to highlight the cost of switching prompts, which will further discern what part of the task is most difficult for patients (e.g. inhibition of information or activation of information). In past experiments, we have found that vmPFC patients have difficulty with both schema-based and category-based tasks, but it is still unclear what part of the task is most difficult for them. Participants will be directed to respond as accurately as possible and will be given a window of 2000 milliseconds for a response, with a 500 millisecond inter-stimulus interval. Data will be collected for accuracy and reaction time, in addition to continuous electroencephalography recording. I will be using e-prime to program the experiment. Pseudocode-starting with a brief explanation of what the experiment will entail (white text on a black screen for all parts of the experiment)-participant will be able to press any key to begin -the first block will be a practice block, which will include a category (e.g. sports) with a few practice trials so that the participants can get used to pressing the buttons and get familiar with the task-participant will be introduced to the schemas and categories that they will be encountering, there will be 2 test blocks in total (one schema one category), with two possible prompts per knowledge type. These will be counterbalanced across participants and pseudo-randomly switched throughout each block	1. ÒGoing to bed at nightÓ (schema)	2. ÒGoing to the doctorÓ (schema)	3. ÒMammalsÓ (category)	4. ÒBugsÓ (category)-At the start of each block, participants will be told to imagine the prompt for 30 seconds (Òpress any button to begin imaginingÓ, this will start the timed 30 seconds)-after this, the following will appear on the screen: ÒPart 1 (press any button to begin)Ó-each block will contain 180 stimulus words (being fed in from two different lists, one schema, one category); the screen will be arranged in each trial as the following:[prompt][stimulus]Related?   Yes (left key)           No (right key)-each trial will last 2000 millisecond-inter-stimulus interval will be 500ms with a fixation cross presented at the top of the screen where the prompt will be displayed -measurements will be taken for both accuracy and reaction time on each trial in addition to EEG recording-after the last block is finished, the participants will be notified that the experiment has ended -to summarize:Practice trial --> first block --> trials (switching pseudo-randomly, lasting 2000ms) --> ISI (500ms)
